Baghdad International Airport is Iraq’s largest and most important aviation hub, located about 16 km west of central Baghdad. Serving as both a civil and military facility, it is the main base for Iraqi Airways and connects the country to regional and international destinations such as Amman, Istanbul, Dubai, and Tehran. The airport features multiple terminals, cargo facilities, and parallel runways capable of handling wide-body aircraft, while also hosting Iraqi Air Force units and maintaining secure zones once used extensively by U.S. and coalition forces. Today, Baghdad International Airport remains a critical gateway for Iraq’s international travel, trade, and diplomatic engagement.

!!! Warning
    It's crucial that you pay close attention to the frequency you're being transferred to. Do not attempt to guess the next frequency, and never switch frequencies without explicit instructions from the controller. Auto-handoffs are not used at Baghdad. If you're unsure, don’t hesitate to ask for the frequency again!
