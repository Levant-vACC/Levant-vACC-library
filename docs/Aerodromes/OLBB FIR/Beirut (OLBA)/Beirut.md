!!! note
    VFR operations at Rayak Airport are exclusively authorized to follow routes 6 and 7.
    VFR operations at Kleyate Airport are exclusively allowed to follow routes 5 and 7.
    VFR operations at both airports are permitted to utilize only route 7.

### Leaving the ATZ
Once VFR aircraft are ready for departure, they shall be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn they shall be instructed to report leaving the ATZ. VFR procedures inside the Beirut ATZ must be conducted at or below `A030`.

!!! phraseology
    **FYI**: Beirut Tower, FYI holding short M runway 17.  
    **OLBA ADC**: FYI, Beirut Tower, surface winds 320 degrees 5 knots, cleared for take-off runway 17.  
    **FYI**: Roger, cleared for take-off runway 17.  
    **AIRCRAFT ON THE CROSSWIND TURN**  
    **OLBA ADC**: FYI, report leaving the Beirut ATZ , maintain at or below altitude 3000ft.  
    **FYI**: at or below 3000ft, wilco, FYI.

Aircraft requesting to exit the Beirut CTR shall be assigned a clearance limit followed by a valid VFR cruising altitude (+500ft).

!!! phraseology
    **YYC**: Beirut Tower, YYC is requesting to exit the Beirut ATZ via VFR route 7, altitude 3500ft.  
    **BI ADC**: YYC, Beirut Tower, cleared to leave the Beirut ATZ via VFR route 7, maintain altitude 3500ft, squawk 7403, QNH 998 hectopascals.  
    **YYC**: Cleared to leave the Beirut ATZ via VFR route 7, will maintain altitude 3500ft, QNH 998, and squawk 7403, YYC.

Inbound VFR aircraft shall be sent to **ADC** with enough time such that two-way
radio communications have been established before aircraft receive clearance to enter the ATZ.

On initial contact, Beirut **ADC** will pass the instructions for joining the circuit, as well as any other pertinent information such as traﬃc information within the sector.

During times of heavy IFR arrival activity, VFR arrivals may be denied entry into the ATZ and instructed to hold outside of the ATZ awaiting further instructions.

## IFR Operations
All IFR clearances are issued by Beirut **SMC**, ensuring appropriate routing out of the OLBB FIR.

### Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs)
Unlike most aerodromes located within Levant, Beirut has a more structured airspace that has implemented the use of Standard Instrument Departures as the main departure procedures, these are used so that IFR traffic can safely depart the FIR and reduce risk of conflicts, or breaches of prohibited airspaces, allowing for higher traffic volumes within the FIR. 

Controllers shall assign the proper SID exit waypoint based on the first enroute waypoint in their
flight plan, and the proper procedure identifier based on the selected runway for departure.
All SIDs with an identifier of 2D or 1D are valid for runways 17 and 21. SIDs
with an identifier of 1E are valid for runway 03. SIDs with an identifier of 2F are
valid for runways 34 and 35.

Listed below are the SIDs:

|   SID   | 21, 17 | 03 | 34, 35 |
| ------- | ------ | -- | ------ |
|  KALDE  |   2D   | 1E |   2F   |
|  LATEB  |   1D   | 1E |   2F   |
|  LEBOR  |   1D   | 1E |   2F   |
| ~~BOD~~ |  ~~1~~ |~~N/A~~|~~2~~|

!!! abstract "BOD1 and BOD2 departures"
    **BOD** departures are out of service, and are **not** to be issued by controllers.

Departures should primarily adhere to the Standard Instrument Departure (SID) routes, avoiding
radar vectors whenever feasible. If radar vectors are to be assigned, a specific reason must be
provided. Aircraft following the KALDE departure will necessitate radar vectors or direct routing to
the exit waypoint of the FIR. 

### Radar departures
Aircrafts may sometimes require radar vectors if they are unable to accept a Standard Instrument
Departure, or if they are using procedural SIDs based on navigational aids such as BOD or
KALDE, which require vectors or direct to the first enroute waypoint in their flight plan.
In the case of a procedural SID, the flight is given a regular clearance with the SID, then after departure, the enroute or approach controller will issue the flight vectors or direct to the FIR exit waypoint.

For aircrafts who are unable to accept SIDs (for example not RNAV capable), clearance may be issued with radar vectors. Beirut **SMC** is required to adjust their phraseology for a radar departure.

!!! phraseology
    **MEA123**: Beirut Ground, MEA123, request clearance to Jeddah, unable SID, information Alpha.  
    **OLBA SMC**: MEA123, Beirut Ground, Cleared to Jeddah, departure runway 21, expect radar vectors to Kukla after departure, flight planned route, initial climb 5,000 ft, squawk 4301. 

Beirut **ADC** is responsible for issuing the initial heading of the departing aircraft with the
take-off clearance.

!!! phraseology
    **MEA123**: Beirut Tower, MEA123, at H ready for departure.  
    **OLBA ADC**: MEA123, turn right heading 220 degrees after departure, winds 210 degrees at 6 knots, runway 21 cleared for takeoff. 

## Standard Taxi Routes
All departing aircraft from terminal A shall be assigned taxiways L and A for runway 21, all aircraft shall be assigned holding point H, unless an intersection departure is requested by the pilot, or for the purposes of sequencing taxiway G may be used for departure. Taxiway F shall never be used for departing aircraft. Beirut **SMC** is encouraged to make use of procedural taxi instructions, in-case of arriving traffic on taxiway A and to reduce potential conflicts.

## Runway Modes

### Preferred Runway Modes
Winds must always be considered for Runway modes (Crosswind <20kts, Tailwind <5kts), however the order of preference is as follows:

| Priority - Mode | Arrivals | Departures | Remarks |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1 - MODE A | 16 | 21 | VFR 17 |
| 2 - MODE B | 03 | 34 | VFR 35|
| 3 - MODE C | 21 | 21 | VFR 17 |

!!! note
    To operate in MODE C, **you must receive prior approval from the Levant ATS department**.

## Beirut Flow
The **FMP** position shall only be activated during major events or when authorized by the ATS department. This position is in charge of sequencing aircraft for push and ensuring that all departures push on time. It is only beneficial when large amounts of traffic and when performed carefully and deliberately.

### Position Operations
During events, Beirut Flow shall be in charge of the following:

- Ensuring all event traffic push and depart on time according to their event ETOT; and
- Ensuring that all non-event traffic are coordinated and provided with a proper departure slot; and
- Assisting **SMC** to check and validating flightplans, and push-back time slots


## Coordination

### Departure Procedures
Due to the airspace structure in Beirut, only departures flying radar vector departures shall be coordinated with the **TMA** controller before release.

'Next' coordination is **not** required to Beirut **TMA** for aircraft that are:

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and
- Assigned the Standard assignable level; and
- Assigned a **Procedural SID**; or
- Assigned a **Standard Assignable Heading**

'Next' coordination is additionally required for:

- Visual depatures (eg. VFR aircraft)
- All departures not on a Standard Assignable Heading
- After a go around, the next departure from that runway

The Standard Assignable level from Beirut **ADC** to **TMA** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| -------- | ----- |
| All | The lower of `RFL` or `A050` |
