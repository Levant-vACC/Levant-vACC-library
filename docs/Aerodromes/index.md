The following documentation outlines the general operating procedures for our airports at an aerodrome level. Some documents serve as supplements to the **Arabian MATS Part 1 – Operating Procedures, Arabian MATS Part 2 – Operating Techniques, Arabian MATS Wake Turbulence Separation, and the relevant aerodrome charts**. These SOP(s) should be used in conjunction with the aforementioned sources. In case of any discrepancies between the aerodrome-specific procedures in this SOP and the Arabian MATS, the procedures in these SOP(s) shall take precedence. The referenced documentation is available in the Foundations section of this site.
