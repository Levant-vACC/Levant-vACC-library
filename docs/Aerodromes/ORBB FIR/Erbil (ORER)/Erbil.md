| --------- | --------	| ---------	| -------- | ------- |
| **Erbil ADC** | **Erbil Tower** | **128.800** | **ORER_TWR** | |
| **Erbil ATIS** | | **130.400** | **ORER_ATIS** | |

## Airspace - Class D

ORER_TWR is responsible for the Erbil CTR airspace from `SFC` to `A060`.

## VFR Operations
All VFR clearances are assigned by the revelant TWR controller.

### Circuits
VFR Circuits are permitted on runways **36** and **18**.

All VFR aircraft wishing to do remain in the circuit at Erbil shall be issued `A030` and the following circuit directions:

| Runway | Direction |
| ------ | --------- |
|   18   | Right |
|   36   | Left |

!!! phraseology
    **ABC**: Erbil Tower, ABC holding short A1 runway 18.  
    **RER ADC**: ABC, Erbil Tower, cleared to operate in the circuit area not above altitude 3000ft, right hand circuits report on the downwind, surface winds 320 degrees 5 knots, cleared for take-off runway 18.  
    **ABC**: Cleared to operate in the circuit area not above altitude 3000ft, will report on the right downwind, cleared for take-off runway 18, ABC.

VFR Circuits shall **not** be permitted at the aerodrome during times of increased IFR departure or arrival activity.

### Leaving the CTR
Once VFR aircraft are ready for departure, they shall be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn they shall be instructed to report leaving the CTR. VFR procedures inside the Erbil CTR must be conducted at or below `A060`.

!!! phraseology
    **FYI**: Erbil Tower, FYI holding short A1 runway 18.  
    **RER ADC**: FYI, Erbil Tower, surface winds 320 degrees 5 knots, cleared for take-off runway 18.  
    **FYI**: Roger, cleared for take-off runway 18.  
    **AIRCRAFT ON THE CROSSWIND TURN**  
    **RER ADC**: FYI, report leaving the Erbil CTR, maintain at or below altitude 6000ft.  
    **FYI**: At or below 6000ft, wilco, FYI.

Aircraft requesting to exit the Erbil CTR shall be assigned a clearance limit followed by a valid VFR cruising altitude (+500ft).

!!! phraseology
    **YYC**: Erbil Tower, YYC is requesting to exit the Erbil CTR via direct Kirkuk, altitude 5500ft.  
    **RER ADC**: YYC, Erbil Tower, cleared to leave the Erbil CTR direct Kirkuk, maintain altitude 5500ft, squawk 7403, QNH 998 hectopascals.  
    **YYC**: Cleared to leave the Erbil CTR direct Kirkuk, maintain altitude 5500ft, QNH 998, and squawk 7403, YYC.

Inbound VFR aircraft shall be sent to **ADC** with enough time such that two-way
radio communications have been established before aircraft receive clearance to enter the CTR.

On initial contact, Erbil **ADC** will pass the instructions for joining the circuit, as well as any other pertinent information such as traï¬ƒc information with the sector.

!!! phraseology
    **YYC**: Erbil Tower, YYC is requesting to enter the Erbil CTR from the south for circuits.    
    **RER ADC**: YYC, Erbil Tower, information A, cleared to enter the Erbil CTR, maintain at or below altitude 6000ft, report right downwind runway 18 with intentions, squawk 7403. 
    **YYC**: We have A, cleared to enter the Erbil CTR, at or below altitude 6000ft, will report right downwind runway 18 with intentions, squawk 7403, YYC.  
    **RER ADC**: YYC, correct, QNH 998 hectopascals.   

During times of heavy IFR arrival activity, VFR arrivals may be denied entry into the CTR and instructed to hold outside of the CTR awaiting further instructions.

## Standard Taxi Routes
All departing aircraft shall be assigned the most appropriate taxiway, onto taxiway A. Erbil **ADC** must exercise extreme caution on taxiway A, as conflicts can easily occur between arriving and departing traffic. Taxiway B is restricted to military traffic only.

## Runway Modes
### Preferred Runway Modes
Winds must always be considered for Runway modes (Crosswind <20kts, Tailwind <5kts), however the order of preference is as follows:

| Priority - Mode | Arrivals | Departures | Remarks |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1 - MODE A | 18 | 18 | |
| 2 - MODE B | 36 | 36 | |

## Coordination

### Departure Procedures
Due to the airspace structure in Erbil, all departures shall be coordinated and receive a release for departure with the relevant **TMA** controller (ORKK_APP)before release.

'Next' coordination is **not** required to Kirkuk **TMA** for aircraft that are:

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and
- Assigned the Standard assignable level; and
- Assigned a **Procedural SID**; or
- Assigned a **Standard Assignable Heading**

'Next' coordination is additionally required for:

- Visual depatures (eg. VFR aircraft)
- All departures not on a Standard Assignable Heading
- After a go around, the next departure from that runway

The Standard Assignable level from Erbil **ADC** to Kirkuk **TMA** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| -------- | ----- |
| IFR | `A060` |
| VFR | `A060` |

### Standard Assignable Departure Headings
As there are no SIDs currently used in Erbil, aircraft must recieve an assigned heading with their line up or take-off clearance. 'Next' coordination is not required to the relevant Kirkuk **TMA** controller when the departing aircraft has been assigned the standard assignable level and assigned one of the headings listed below:

| Runway | Heading |
| ------ | ------- |
| 18 | `H175` |
| 36 | `H355` |


!!! tip
    If strong winds are present at altitude, **ADC/TMA** should discuss slight changes to these headings (+/- 5 degrees) to compensate for large crosswind components.

!!! phraseology
    **IAW23**: IAW23 ready for departure.  
    **RER ADC**: IAW23, after departure climb to altitude 6000ft, fly runway heading, surface winds variable at 3 knots, runway 18 cleared for take-off.
