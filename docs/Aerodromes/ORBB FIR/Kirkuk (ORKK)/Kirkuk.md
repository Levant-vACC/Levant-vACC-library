    **KIK ADC**: YYC, correct, QNH 998 hectopascals.    

During times of heavy IFR arrival activity, VFR arrivals may be denied entry into the CTR and instructed to hold outside of the CTR awaiting further instructions.

## IFR Operations
IFR clearances are issued by Kirkuk **SMC**, ensuring appropriate routing. IFR departures shall always be assigned runway 31/13.

All departing aircrat will fly an omni-directional departure.

!!! warning

## Runway Modes
### Preferred Runway Modes
Winds must always be considered for Runway modes (Crosswind <20kts, Tailwind <5kts), however the order of preference is as follows:

| Priority - Mode | Arrivals | Departures | Remarks |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1 - MODE A | 31 | 31 | |
| 2 - MODE B | 13 | 13 | |

    The preferential runway is runway 31. 

## Coordination
### Departure Procedures
Due to the airspace structure in Kirkuk, all departures shall be coordinated and receive a release for departure with the relevant Baghdad **TMA** controller (ORKK_APP) before release.

'Next' coordination is **not** required to Baghdad **TMA** for aircraft that are:

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and
- Assigned the Standard assignable level; and
- Assigned a **Standard Assignable Heading**

'Next' coordination is additionally required for:

- Visual depatures (eg. VFR aircraft)
- All departures not on a Standard Assignable Heading
- After a go around, the next departure from that runway

The Standard Assignable level from Kirkuk **ADC** to Baghdad **TMA** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| -------- | ----- |
| IFR | `A040` |
| VFR | `A040` |


### Standard Assignable Departure Headings
All aircraft that are flying an omni-directional departure must recieve an assigned heading with their line up or take-off clearance. 'Next' coordination is not required to the relevant Baghdad **TMA** controller when the departing aircraft has been assigned the standard assignable level and assigned one of the headings listed below:

| Runway | Heading |
| ------ | ------- |
| 13 | `H128` |
| 31 | `H308` |

!!! tip
    If strong winds are present at altitude, **ADC/TMA** should discuss slight changes to these headings (+/- 5 degrees) to compensate for large crosswind components.

!!! phraseology
    **IAW23**: IAW23 ready for departure.  
    **KIK ADC**: IAW23, after departure climb to altitude 4000ft, fly runway heading, surface winds variable at 3 knots, runway 31 cleared for take-off.
