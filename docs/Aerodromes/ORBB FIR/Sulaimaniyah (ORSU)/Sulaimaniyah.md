## Airspace - Class D

ORSU_TWR is responsible for the Sulaymaniyah CTR airspace from `SFC` to `A060`.

## VFR Operations
All VFR clearances are assigned by the revelant TWR controller.

### Circuits
VFR Circuits are permitted on runways **13** and **31**.

All VFR aircraft wishing to do remain in the circuit at Sulaymaniyah shall be issued `A030` and the following circuit directions:

| Runway | Direction |
| ------ | --------- |
|   31   |    Left   |
|   13   |   Right   |

!!! phraseology
    **ABC**: Sulaymaniyah Tower, ABC holding short E runway 31, full ready.    
    **ISU ADC**: ABC, Sulaymaniyah Tower, cleared to operate in the circuit area not above altitude 3000ft, left hand circuits report on the downwind, surface winds 320 degrees 5 knots, cleared for take-off runway 31.  
    **ABC**: Cleared to operate in the circuit area not above altitude 3000ft, will report on the left downwind, cleared for take-off runway 31, ABC.  

VFR Circuits shall **not** be permitted at the aerodrome during times of increased IFR departure or arrival activity.

### Leaving the CTR
Once VFR aircraft are ready for departure, they shall be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn they shall be instructed to report leaving the CTR. VFR procedures inside the Sulaymaniyah CTR must be conducted at or below `A060`.

!!! phraseology
    **FYI**: Sulaymaniyah Tower, FYI holding short E, runway 31.  
    **ISU ADC**: FYI, Sulaymaniyah Tower, surface winds 320 degrees 5 knots, cleared for take-off runway 18.  
    **FYI**: Roger, cleared for take-off runway 31.  
    **AIRCRAFT ON THE CROSSWIND TURN**  
    **ISU ADC**: FYI, report leaving the Sulaymaniyah CTR, maintain at or below altitude 6000ft.  
    **FYI**: At or below 6000ft, wilco, FYI.

Aircraft requesting to exit the Sulaymaniyah CTR shall be assigned a clearance limit followed by a valid VFR cruising altitude (+500ft).

!!! phraseology
    **YYC**: Sulaymaniyah Tower, YYC is requesting to exit the Sulaymaniyah CTR via direct Erbil, altitude 7500ft.  
    **ISU ADC**: YYC, Sulaymaniyah Tower, cleared to leave the Sulaymaniyah CTR direct Erbil, maintain altitude 7500ft, squawk 7403, QNH 998 hectopascals.  
    **YYC**: Cleared to leave the Sulaymaniyah CTR direct Erbil, maintain altitude 7500ft, QNH 998, and squawk 7403, YYC.

Inbound VFR aircraft shall be sent to **ADC** with enough time such that two-way
radio communications have been established before aircraft receive clearance to enter the CTR.

On initial contact, Sulaymaniyah **ADC** will pass the instructions for joining the circuit, as well as any other pertinent information such as traﬃc information with the sector.

!!! phraseology
    **YYC**: Sulaymaniyah Tower, YYC is requesting to enter the Sulaymaniyah CTR from the southeast for circuits.     
    **ISU ADC**: YYC, Sulaymaniyah Tower, information A, cleared to enter the Sulaymaniyah CTR, maintain at or below altitude 6000ft, report final runway 18 with intentions, squawk 7403.  
    **YYC**: We have A, cleared to enter the Sulaymaniyah CTR, at or below altitude 6000ft, will report final runway 18 with intentions, squawk 7403, YYC.   
    **ISU ADC**: YYC, correct, QNH 998 hectopascals.    

During times of heavy IFR arrival activity, VFR arrivals may be denied entry into the CTR and instructed to hold outside of the CTR awaiting further instructions.

## IFR Operations
IFR clearances are issued by Sulaymaniyah **ADC**, ensuring appropriate routing.

Aircraft flying IFR may either fly a SID that fly to either waypoint KIRKUK or ERBIL, **or** an omnidirectional departure to one of the following waypoints to join their flight-planned route:  
- TOMSI  
- BOXIX  
- SOBIL  
- MUTAG  

If an aircraft are flying an omnidirectional to one of these waypoints, the Sulmaniyah VOR (SUL) shall always be their first waypoint in the clearance.

### Standard Instrument Departures
Sulaymaniyah makes use of SIDs that fly to either waypoint KIRKUK or ERBIL.

The departure shall be assigned based on the departure waypoint, based on which of these two waypoints is closest to the aircraft’s flight planned route. The SID is designed to allow aircraft to pass the waypoints PUTRI or RASKI, both located 10nm from SUL, at or above `A110`, to avoid terrain to the west and shall be transferred to Kirkuk TMA when passing `A060`

The Standard Instrument Departures available are:

|   SID   | 31|13 | 
| ------- | - | - |
|  ERBIL  | 1 | 2 |
|  KIRKK  | 1 | 2 |

!!! warning
    These departures may **only** be assigned to aircraft departing towards waypoints KIRKUK or ERBIL, other IFR departures shall receive an omni-directional departure.

The departure runway does not need to be included within the clearance, as these SIDs are runway specific.

!!! phraseology
    **IAW123**: Sulaymaniyah Tower, IAW123, request clearance to Antalya, with information Alpha.  
    **ISU ADC**: IAW123, Sulaymaniyah Tower, Cleared to Antalya, KIRKK1 departure, flight planned route, initial climb 6,000 ft, squawk 4301. 


## Standard Taxi Routes
All departing aircraft shall be assigned the most appropriate taxiway, onto taxiway A. Sulaymaniyah **ADC** must exercise extreme caution on taxiway A, as conflicts can easily occur between arriving and departing traffic.

## Runway Modes
### Preferred Runway Modes
Winds must always be considered for Runway modes (Crosswind <20kts, Tailwind <5kts), however the order of preference is as follows:

| Priority - Mode | Arrivals | Departures | Remarks |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1 - MODE A | 31 | 31 | |
| 2 - MODE B | 13 | 13 | |

## Coordination

### Departure Procedures
Due to the airspace structure in Erbil, all departures shall be coordinated and receive a release for departure with the relevant Baghdad **TMA** controller (ORKK_APP)before release.

'Next' coordination is **not** required to Baghdad **TMA** for aircraft that are:

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and
- Assigned the Standard assignable level; and
- Assigned a **Procedural SID**; or
- Assigned a **Standard Assignable Heading**

'Next' coordination is additionally required for:

- Visual depatures (eg. VFR aircraft)
- All departures not on a Standard Assignable Heading
- After a go around, the next departure from that runway

The Standard Assignable level from Erbil **ADC** to Baghdad **TMA** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| -------- | ----- |
| IFR | `A060` |
| VFR | `A060` |

### Standard Assignable Departure Headings
As there are only 2 SIDs currently used in Erbil, aircraft that are flying an omni-directional departure must recieve an assigned heading with their line up or take-off clearance. 'Next' coordination is not required to the relevant Baghdad **TMA** controller when the departing aircraft has been assigned the standard assignable level and assigned one of the headings listed below:

| Runway | Heading |
| ------ | ------- |
| 13 | `H130` |
| 31 | `H310` |

!!! tip
    If strong winds are present at altitude, **ADC/TMA** should discuss slight changes to these headings (+/- 5 degrees) to compensate for large crosswind components.

!!! phraseology
    **IAW23**: IAW23 ready for departure.  
    **ISU ADC**: IAW23, after departure climb to altitude 6000ft, fly runway heading, surface winds variable at 3 knots, runway 13 cleared for take-off.
