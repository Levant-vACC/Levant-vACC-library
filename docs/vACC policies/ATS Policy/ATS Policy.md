# General Provisions

## Scope

This document establishes the standard operating procedures for controllers operating in both their home and visiting capacities within the Levant vACC. The Levant vACC is responsible for providing, managing, and facilitating Air Traffic Control (ATC) services on the VATSIM network across the airspaces of **Iraq**, **Syria**, and **Lebanon**. These services are delivered in alignment with the vACC's core values of ensuring a high standard of realism, professionalism, and operational excellence.

The Levant vACC oversees air traffic controller operations within the **Baghdad FIR (ORBB)**, **Damascus FIR (OSTT)**, and **Beirut FIR (OLBB)**.

All VATSIM members are expected to comply with the VATSIM Code of Conduct and Code of Regulations, which govern behavior and operations across the network.

## Limitation of Liability

This document has been prepared for use on the VATSIM network only. It should never be used for real-world aviation operations. The authors of this document cannot be held liable for any personal injury and/or death from the misuse of this document.

# Controllers

## Conduct

Controllers in the Levant vACC must uphold professionalism and adhere to the following standards:

- **Adherence to VATSIM Regulations**  
  Controllers must comply with the VATSIM Code of Conduct and Code of Regulations.
- **Good Standing Requirement**  
  Controllers must remain in good standing with the Levant vACC, VATMENA, VATEMEA, and the VATSIM network.
- **Violation Consequences**  
  Controllers found violating the VATSIM Code of Conduct, regardless of role (controller, pilot, or observer), will be **immediately removed from the Levant vACC roster**. No prior notice will be given for such removal.
- **Compliance with Policies and Procedures**  
  Controllers must comply with all applicable Levant vACC standards, policies, and procedures, including:  
    - The Levant vACC Training System
    - SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)
    - Operational Changes set by the ATS department
    - Letters of Agreement (LoAs)
- **Zero Tolerance for Misconduct**  
  Hate speech, violence, derogatory remarks, or personal attacks directed at pilots or fellow controllers will result in **immediate and permanent or temporary removal** from the Levant vACC, with further reporting to the VATSIM network.

Failure to comply with the conduct guidelines may lead to disciplinary action, including removal of controlling privileges.

## Training Standards

The Levant vACC strives to maintains a high standard of realism and excellence in ATC operations. 

- **Adherence to Official Procedures**  
  Controllers must follow the procedures outlined in:  
    - Published SOPs  
    - Operational Changes  
    - Letters of Agreement (LoAs)
- **Training Policy Compliance**  
  Controllers must adhere to:  
    - The Levant vACC Training Process for Home and Visiting Controllers  
    - The Levant vACC Activity Requirements Policy

Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action or restricted training and controlling privileges.

## Approved Callsigns

As we strive to maintain a high standard of realism and excellence in air traffic control operations within the vACC, only approved callsigns as listed below are permitted to be opened. While there are some restrictions on certain facilities and callsigns, the rest remain unrestricted.

### List of Unrestricted Positions

| Name | Login ID |
| ---- | -------- |
| Beirut ADC | OLBA_TWR |
| Beirut SMC | OLBA_GND |

## Streaming

The Levant vACC welcomes all our controllers to stream their controlling sessions online in order to influence and show off the vACC.

- **Primary Duty**  
  Controllers who stream their sessions must **prioritize ATC duties** over stream interactions.
- **Voice Call**  
  Controllers intending to stream must:  
    - Notify fellow controllers in the **Discord coordination channel**  
    - Obtain consent from them before streaming in shared voice channels.

All controllers reserve the right to deny consent to any members. If consent is denied, the streaming controller will be required to move to a separate Discord call to avoid disrupting coordination.

## Minimum Connection Min

Controllers are required to meet the following session time requirements:

| Position | Minimum Session Time |
|:--------:|:--------------------:|
| DEL/GND |      30 Minutes      |
| TWR     |      30 Minutes      |
| DEP/APP |      30 Minutes      |
| CTR     |      30 Minutes      |

Sessions under 30 minutes will not be counted toward the controller's quarterly total. Repeated non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action.

## Commencing a Session

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
  a[Controller checks out VATSIM Radar or equivalent to see if ATC is online] --> b[Adjacent controllers are online] --> c[Log on the network with an approved callsign] --> d[Coordinate with the next controller to determine ATIS, runways in use, and operational info] --> h[Announce controller presence in 'ATC chat']
    a[Controller checks out VATSIM Radar or equivalent to see if ATC is online] --> f[Adjacent controllers are not online] --> g[Log on the network with an approved callsign] --> h[Announce controller presence in 'ATC chat']
```

## Discord Presence

Though not mandated, for coordination purposes, controllers should present in the appropriate coordination channel on Discord to allow for smoother coordination. 

However during events, controllers are **MANDATED** to remain present in the appropriate coordination channel on Discord to allow for smoother coordination among adjacent controllers.

## Relief Callsigns

Controllers relieving others during peak hours or events must use a relief callsign (e.g. ORBB_RN_CTR) to ensure proper transition and avoid disruption.

## Ending a Session

Controllers must notify others of their intent to disconnect using the `.break` function on EuroScope and announce it on frequency at least 5 minutes before disconnecting.

# Non-compliance with this Policy


Ignorance of policies is not an acceptable defense. It is each memberâ€™s responsibility to stay informed of the latest procedures. Repeated violations will result in the revocation of approvals.
