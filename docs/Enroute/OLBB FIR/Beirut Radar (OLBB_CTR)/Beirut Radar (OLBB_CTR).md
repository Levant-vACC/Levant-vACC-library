Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport (BEY), Lebanon’s sole commercial airport, lies about 9 km south of central Beirut and serves as the country’s main air gateway. Opened in 1954 and expanded in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it features a U-shaped terminal with East and West wings, 23 gates (19 with jetways), and multiple passenger amenities including lounges, duty-free, cafés, and free limited-time Wi-Fi. It is the primary hub for Middle East Airlines (MEA), connecting Beirut to key destinations such as Dubai, Istanbul, Cairo, Doha, Paris, and Riyadh. Accessible by taxi, ride-share, and bus, the airport is crucial for travel and trade, especially amid regional instability—MEA currently operates most flights, using coastal approach routes to reduce risk. Despite conflict in the surrounding area, BEY remains a vital lifeline linking Lebanon to the rest of the world.
